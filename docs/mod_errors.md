# Why do mods sometimes not work?

Sometimes, the mods will break when google make changes to the code for snake.
This may affect only some of the google snake mods or it may affect all of them.

We will try to fix the snake mods whenever this happens.
This typically can take a few days depending on how busy we are and how broken the mods are.

Please be patient when this happens.

March 2023 note: [Enabling the mod in incognito mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/702123/how-to-enable-an-extension-in-chromes-incognito-mode/) and then running the mod in incognito mode (ctrl+shift+n on chrome) will fix these errors for some users. This is because google are running an A/B test and the mods only work for the "control" group. Installing the mod in a ddifferent chrome profile or browser may also work.

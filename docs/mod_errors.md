# Why do mods sometimes not work?

<strong>April 2023 Note</strong>: Some people are getting an experimental version of google snake where some mods don't work (More Menu Mod, Dice Mod). Try playing on a different domain instead - https://www.google.ca/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade https://www.google.de/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade https://www.google.it/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade for more info see [here](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/blob/main/docs/different_version.md).

Sometimes, the mods will break when Google changes the code for the snake.
This may affect only some of the google snake mods, or it may affect all of them.

We will fix the snake mods whenever this happens.
This typically can take a few days, depending on how busy we are and how broken the mods are.

Please be patient when this happens.

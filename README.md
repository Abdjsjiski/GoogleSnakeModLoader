# Google Snake Mod Loader

New way to get snake mods since bookmarks broke.

# How to install

1) Install a userscript manager. If you are on chrome you can use the "tampermonkey" extension.

2) Click this link to install the userscript and then confirm it.<br>
[INSTALL](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/raw/main/googlesnakemodloader-dev.user.js)

3) Play Google Snake (mod will run automatically). Search snake should work, but the [fbx](https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade) page is recommended.

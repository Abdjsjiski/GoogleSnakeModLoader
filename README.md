# Google Snake Mod Loader

New way to get snake mods since bookmarks broke.

Featured mods (may change):
- Custom Menu Stuff (More Menu mod)
- Level Editor Mod
- Mouse Mode

# How to install

1) Install a userscript manager. We recommend the Tampermonkey browser extension for this, although there are alternatives.

Use the relevant link for your browser.

| Browser  | Link |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Chrome  | [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  |
| Firefox  | [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) |
| Safari  | [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari)  |
| Microsoft Edge  | [Tampermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)  |
| Opera  | [Tampermonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)  |

2) Click one of the install links below to get the snake mod and confirm it. The version will depend on what you search for to play google snake or whether you play it on the standalone fbx page (https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade)<br>

| Where do you play snake  | Description | Install |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| I use a search term including the word snake (google snake, snake game etc). Many other languages work too (serpiente, serpent, slange, [full list](#Search-terms-for-standard-version))  | Works for common search terms and on the fbx page. | [INSTALL (standard)](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/raw/main/build/snake-mod-loader-standard.user.js) |
| standalone fbx page only  | Recommended if you only play on the fbx page | [INSTALL (fbx-only)](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/raw/main/build/snake-mod-loader-fbx.user.js) |
| anywhere | This version will run on every google search page, so only use it if the other versions don't run for you | [INSTALL (international)](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/raw/main/build/snake-mod-loader-intl.user.js) |

3) Play Google Snake. The mod will run automatically. A panel will show up in the bottom right that lets you choose which mod to run.

### Search terms for standard version

The standard version will work for search terms including any of the below words/phrases. It must have the full word (i.e. "google snaking" or "google snaek" won't work, since it doesn't contain the word snake)

serpent  
serpente  
贪吃蛇

We made this list with google translate, so please raise an [issue](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/issues) if you use a search term that doesn't contain any of these words or if any of the listed words are incorrect.
